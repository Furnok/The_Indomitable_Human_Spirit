  _value: "And it came to pass in this age of dark wickedness, that pestilence did
    invade the face of the earth, and the harvests did perish, and the beasts of
    the field were smitten with madness. The earth did weep with countless sorrows,
    and disease did cover the nations as a thick cloud doth cover the angry heavens.
    For the Adversary, who is called Satan, did arise once more before the Eternal
    and did say in his heart: \u201CAre they not all inclined to corruption? Are
    they not all of vain nature?\u201D  And he was called before the throne of Light,
    and God did say unto him: \u201CHast thou considered My servant Job? He remaineth
    upright in his heart.\u201D But the Adversary murmured once more and did reply:
    \u201CSuffer me to touch the work of Thy hands, and Thou shalt see if they do
    not turn away from Thee.\u201D Then the Eternal, in His infinite wisdom, permitted
    the beast to blow upon the creation, not to break them, but to prove the free
    will of the children of Adam.  And thereupon, a thousand plagues were sent upon
    the earth, and the men were bowed down under the weight of their own misery.
    In great distress, they did curse the Name of the Eternal, and the temples were
    cast down, and the altars were defiled with the blood of hatred. But God was
    not angry, for He saw the truth in the hearts of His creatures.  Then the Deceiver
    appeared unto them in a form that was not veiled, and did say: \u201CI am he
    whom ye fear, but I am also your salvation. Turn ye unto me, and I shall deliver
    you from the evils of this world.\u201D And many among the children of the earth,
    even the most faithful, did yield to his charms, and did forget their first love.
    And God was grieved in His spirit.  And it came to pass that He turned His face
    from the world, and angels fell from the sky, and the Adversary did reign over
    the earth which he had conquered by seduction. The light did extinguish from
    the heavens, and the voice of the prophets did cease. The faithful were scattered
    as seed that is carried away by the wind.  And it came to pass that the man of
    God, a servant armed with the word and the sword, embarked for a far-off isle,
    in the forgotten borders of earthly kingdoms. For he had heard tell that there
    did dwell a village, the last bastion of the faithful unto the Most High, not
    yet bowed beneath the yoke of the Deceiver."
